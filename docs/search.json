    "text": "Original Map\nSource: https://www.worldatlas.com/climate/the-10-driest-cities-in-the-united-states.html \nThis is a map from WorldAtlas of the top ten driest cities in the United States. The map is stylized and emphasizes the rankings of each of the ten driest cities. It features nice graphics, such as the drop-shaped map pins and the globe with a thermometer in the top left.\nIssues With the Map:\n\nThe black borders of the states containing the selected cities make the black label pointer lines harder to follow.\nThe information takes a while to gather because the map is busy with spread out information.\nThe color choice is counterintuitive to read because light-to-dark color scales often have the high values represented with the darker shades of color. Having the raindrop-shaped rankings getting darker, to me, implies that there is more rain for the darker drops. The red color may have been chosen to represent heat or an extreme and unfavorable value.\nThe title of the map isn‚Äôt exactly what is being measured. Depending on what someone means by ‚Äúdryness‚Äù, inches of rain per month as a lone metric could be an insufficient indicator. Measurements like humidity, temperature, and sun exposure could all arguably be equally important indicators or at least factor into a city‚Äôs dryness.\n\n\n\nBar Graph Redesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis simple ordered bar chart allows the viewer to very quickly see that the 10 driest cities have roughly 30-15% of the rainfall of the US national average. This is information that can not be gathered from looking at the original map. To be fair, right under the original map, it is stated that ‚ÄúIn most of the United States, rainfall averages close to 30 inches a year, but some cities get less than a third of that.‚Äù This bar graph just conveys that information so much more efficiently.\nAnother great thing about this ordered bar chart is that you can quickly compare the values of different cities and see how minor or major the differences in their rainfall values are.\n\n\nDynamic Map Redesign\nTop Ten U.S. Cities with the Least Rainfall\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dynamic map is inspired by the format of the original and meant to act as an improved version. It preserves the original emphasis of the ranks of the 10 cities and shows their locations, but the color scale is now more intuitive, with the darker blue values having more rainfall rather than the original lighter red points having more rainfall.\nWith this being a dynamic map, the user can now zoom in with a satellite view and get a look at what the ten driest cities in the US look like. The viewer can also click on the data points to reveal more information. This map has some more information about each city that one might want to know, with some of the new information relating to dryness.\nWhen looking at the new data it can be observed that temperature values and humidity levels are somewhat correlated with rainfall in these cities, but it is possible for one city to have more rainfall than another but still be hotter and less humid.\nSources for Additional data used in the 2nd visualization:\n- Wikipedia: Latitude/longitude and elevation Values\n- US Census Bureau: Metropolitan area population values\n- Weatherandclimate.com: Temperature and humidity values"

    "text": "Original State Map of Opioid Dispensing Rates\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map shows retail pharmacy dispensed opioid prescriptions per 100 persons per year in 2019 and 2023. The current CDC map of opioid dispensing rates uses four fixed categories (&lt;34.9, 34.9‚Äì42.0, 42.1‚Äì51.7, &gt;51.7). While simple, this approach has several key problems:\n\nObscures variation: The top category (&gt;51.7) lumps together rates from 52 to 71. This means states with moderately high rates and those with extremely high rates appear identical, hiding important differences.\n\nFor example, in 2023, Kansas had a dispensing rate of 52.8, while Arkansas was much higher at 71.5 ‚Äî yet both appear identical on the map.\n\nIgnores change over time: The map only shows a single year and does not reveal how rates have changed from 2019 to 2023, preventing understanding of trends or improvements across states.\nStatic thresholds distort trends: Using the same cutoffs across years can make overall increases or decreases invisible, since many states may shift within a category without any visual change on the map.\nColor choice issues: Using only a few discrete colors for broad categories reduces the map‚Äôs ability to reflect subtle differences, making it harder to distinguish states with similar rates or identify regional patterns.\nOverall, the current map‚Äôs categorical bins and limited color scheme oversimplify the data and fail to communicate both the magnitude of high rates and temporal trends, making it less useful for analysis or policy insights.\n\n\n\nüìäStacked Bar Graph Redesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stacked bar graph compares opioid dispensing rates between 2019 and 2023 for each state, highlighting how rates have changed over time.\nYou can toggle between 2019, 2023, or view both years together to see trends more clearly.\nThis design highlights both the absolute rates, making it easy to see which states made the greatest progress and which showed minimal change or slight increases.\nThe visualization helps viewers quickly identify national patterns and understand how opioid dispensing rates have shifted over the four-year period.\nKey Features:\n\nHighlights the decrease in opioid dispensing rates over time.\nYou can quickly identify which states had the largest decreases, as well as states with minimal change or slight increases.\nProvides a direct, data-driven view of national trends and state-level progress.\n\n\n\nüó∫Ô∏è Heat Map Redesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heat map visualizes opioid dispensing rates across the U.S., using color intensity to show severity ‚Äî the darker the red, the more severe the rate in that state.\nKey Features:\n\nRed indicates higher rates, with darker red showing the most severe dispensing levels.\nUses a continuous color scale instead of categories, showing the full range of values.\nMakes it easier to identify regional clusters of high opioid dispensing.\nHighlights where opioid dispensing is most concentrated across the country.\nProvides a more detailed and nuanced view than the original CDC map."
